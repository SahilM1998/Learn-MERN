1 -> Hello world using node and express

We will use different dependency such as express mongoDb react
so we will import these depen in our project

To store all this we will have a package.json file which will have all of these dependency
Its tells about the meta data

cmd to create a package,json file ----> npm init -y

In this project we will be using backend as Node js and it's framework express js

To install a express package in your project use this cmd ---->npm i express

To use express we have to require it first
syntax
const expressOne = requires('express');
const app = expressOne();
now expressOne contains multiple functions method and properties and to access them we have a variable app create to use them

app.get(path,callback);
If we want some data on our page then we will use .get method
ex on home page we want hello welcome to the home page then we will use

app.get('/home',(req,res)=>{
res.send('hello welcome to the home page'); ----->since we need to send response from server i.e this content should be Visible
});

req------>Request
res------>Response

()=>{} this is fatarrow function
'/home' it is mentioning which page we are visiting

Now how will server will let to know that some response is made to the port
so for that we will use listen

app.listen(3000,()=>{
console.log(`server is running at port=3000`)
})

app.listen(Port,msg)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------xxx---------------

2 -> Middlewares using NodeJS & Express JS

It will redirect from one page to another
so it is checking if user is authenticated or not user is genuine or not
if not the show login page and not the about page

Middleware fuction are the fuctions that have access to the request object,response object and the next function in the application request response cycle

next is a function in express router which when invoked executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware

middleware(); -----> calling a function

defining that fuction
const middleware = (req,res,next)=>{
condition to check
next(); // then move to the requested root
}

Inshort if we want to visit the page before showing the data we will check using middleware and if true then will will visit that page or we will route to correct page

Inbetween working two page we will used middleware

---------------------------------------------------------------------------xxxx--------------------------

3 -> Connect (Backend to Database) MongoDB Atlas with NodeJS using Mongoose

we will create a new project in mongoDB
First we have to build a cluster
then inside that cluster we will create a collection
In network add IP address also

In collection we are creating a database for the application

then we will have to connect using the connection option
with username and passowrd these both will be used to connect in project file
also copy the connection string also for reference

cmd to install mongoose ----> npm i mongoose

to connect Backend to Database

const mongoose = require('mongoose')
const DB = 'connection string copied from mongo db'
mongoose.connect(DB).then(()=>{
console.log(`successful connection`);
}).catch((err)=>console.log(err));

then()=> promise fulfilled or not
note add password which we had set and also the database name in the string

------------------------------------------------------------------------------xxxx----------------------

4 -> Secure You Code by Keeping your Password, API Keys Secret with DOTENV

to keep confidential data secure

config.env file
will staore all the confidential data inside this file

cmd to install dotenv package ---> npm i dotenv

const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config({ path: './config.env' }); /// to use the data of that config file

const DB = process.env.DATABASE;

if we have mentioned the path of config.env in app.js then there is no need to define process.env in other files

to require a file in app.js
require('./db/conn');

--------------------------------------------------vvvvvv-----------------------------------------------

5 -> Creating the User Schema & Model

user schema - defines the structure of the document

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
package require

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
name:{
type: String,
required:true
},
email:{
type: String,
required:true
}

})
new instance created and we have used a class Schema

with the help of models we can connect it the project

const User = mongoose.model(collecton name#USER,userSchema);

to use the User we will export it

module.exports = User;

to use it in app.js suppose we can use it
const User = require('./model/userSchema')

-------------------------------------------------xxxxx--------------------------------------------------

6 -> Express Router Middleware

we have link the router files to make it easy
app.use('./router/auth')

cont router = express.Router()
router.get('/', function)

it worls on top to bottom approach

.get -> it will display data on website
.post-> jo user ne input kiya hai on website voh milega

to used json data we will use
app.use(express.json())

-----------------------------------------------------xxxx-------------------------------------------------

7 -> Storing the User Data in the Online Database using Express & Mongoose
